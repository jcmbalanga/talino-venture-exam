# talino-venture-exam

The coding exam is fun, the questions are new to me so I have to check all possible outcome first to validate if there are things I missed but overall I enjoyed it. The last question is the hardest for me, at first I tried to store the sequence in an array then check the length of it but there are times that the output is incorrect so I took more time on this to validate the correct output.

To run the code, in the terminal, run this command "python {directory_to_script}"
